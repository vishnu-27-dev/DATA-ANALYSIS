# CAR PRICE REDICTION MODEL
For this I have used Predictive Analysis. By using patterns found in older data as well as current events, analysts predict future events. While thereâ€™s no such thing as 100 percent accurate forecasting, the odds improve if the analysts have plenty of detailed information and the discipline to research it thoroughly.
And for the price prediction I have implemented Machine Learning model (Linear Regression) for price prediction.

I have uploaded all the code related information via files.
